It involved understanding how the algorithm uses a recursive approach to check for duplicates while traversing the tree. By testing the code with a sample tree, I learned about the importance of recursion in solving tree-related problems and the necessity of thorough testing to ensure the correctness and effectiveness of the solution. This exercise helped me to understand algorithms in the context of binary trees and proved the value of systematic analysis and testing in writing reliable codes.\n",

I tried a few new inputs with known outputs and used her code, all outputs were correct. I concluded her code is right even though such conclusions cannot be generalized for inputs of any length and order. I then thought if there are any other ways of achieving the same by taking less time and/or space."
